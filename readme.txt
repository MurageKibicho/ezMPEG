Welcome to ezMPEG

http://sourceforge.net/projects/ezmpeg

ezMPEG is an easy-to-use and easy-to-understand MPEG1 video encoder API

This documentation is still in development and incomplete. The exact description
of the encoder API will follow as soon as possible. Until then please have a
look at the example within this release to see how it works.

To use the API just include 'ezmpeg.h' in your files and compile with
gcc yourfile.c ezmpeg.c -o yourfile

You are free to use any other C compiler than gcc
